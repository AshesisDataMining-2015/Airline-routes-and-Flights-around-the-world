This project would explore the relationship between different airports around the world in terms of number of airline routes they connect to. It would further draw relationships between the number of airline routes of airports in a country and the level of economic development that country around the world. It would make use of tools such as R and Ghephi to explore these relationships and make graphical illustrate of them. It uses data from the OpenFlight official website.
